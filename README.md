# Newspoints

Newspoints is an Android application that enables journalists to record Audio clips, Video footages, and at the same time tag Questions for Audio/Video, Sources as well as Shots. Newspoints helps arrange the collected assets and information for production and editing. 

## Why Newspoints?
Usually journalists record information about an incident on paper and later arrange the content they have recorded with some modification before publishing it. It is often strenuous and time-consuming to record every single minute piece of information on paper and later recall it to map that information to its corresponding incident. This not only adds laborious work and decreases productivity but could also restrains journalists from recollecting important points about the incident which can in turn potentially reduce the speed and accuracy of their reporting.

## What problem are we solving?
The primary goal of Newspoints is to allow journalists to take record incidents and information concurrently in real time. In addition, this application helps journalist’s record details of an incident with few clicks while at the same time eliminating the need to carry usual tools such as paper, pen, audio recorder and camera. Newspoints also helps to attach necessary pieces of information along with Audio and Videos

## How are we achieveing our goal?
Newspoints organizes and guides producers through the digital newsgathering and reporting process. Notes, multimedia and interviews and research are automatically tagged, geocoded and linked in real time. Newspoints “guides” prompt producers through their newsgathering. “Guides” provide templates for news reporting situations based on input from experienced reporters, editors, producers and journalism educators. Newspoints also record the geo location coordinated of every clip being recorded. All this information is stored in an XML file in a particular format. This XML file is passed as input to the Newspoints application which then parses this XML file and shows all the questions to be asked while conducting an interview, source name and shot type.
